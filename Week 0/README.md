Week 0: VLSI System Design (VSD) ‚Äì Environment Setup

Welcome to the VLSI System Design (VSD) program repository! This week was all about setting up the foundation for the entire VLSI workflow ‚Äî from RTL synthesis to layout visualization. The goal was to prepare a stable and functional environment so that design and simulation tasks run smoothly.

üñ• System & Virtual Machine Setup

To run all the VLSI tools efficiently, I configured a virtual machine with the following specs:

OS: Ubuntu 24.04

RAM: 6 GB

Storage: 50 GB HDD

vCPUs: 4

üí° Tip: This configuration ensures enough memory and CPU resources for compilation, simulation, and waveform visualization without slowdowns.

‚öô Tools Installed

This week I installed and verified the following open-source VLSI tools:

Yosys ‚Äì RTL synthesis

Icarus Verilog (iverilog) ‚Äì Verilog simulation

GTKWave ‚Äì Waveform analysis

Ngspice ‚Äì Analog & mixed-signal circuit simulation

Magic VLSI ‚Äì Layout design and visualization

1Ô∏è‚É£ Yosys ‚Äì RTL Synthesis
