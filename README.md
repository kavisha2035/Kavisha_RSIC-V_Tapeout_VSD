# 🖥️ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Journey – VSD Program

Welcome to my documentation of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** under the VLSI System Design (VSD) initiative!  

This repository tracks my weekly progress as I go from **RTL design** to a fully **tapeout-ready SoC**, using open-source EDA tools and collaborative workflows.

## 🚀 About the Program

The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** is a hands-on initiative that empowers participants to design, synthesize, and implement a complete system-on-chip (SoC). This program is part of a national effort to boost India’s semiconductor capabilities, bringing together thousands of students and professionals to learn and contribute.

### 🎯 Key Highlights

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Learning Path** | End-to-end SoC design: RTL → Synthesis → Physical Design → Tapeout |
| **Tools** | Open-source EDA ecosystem: Yosys, OpenLane, Magic, and more |
| **Practical Relevance** | Real-world semiconductor design workflows |
| **Collaboration** | Join a community of 3500+ participants working on silicon design |
| **National Impact** | Contributing to India’s semiconductor ecosystem growth |

## 🛠️ Program Workflow

1. **RTL Design** – Writing synthesizable Verilog code for SoC components  
2. **Synthesis** – Converting RTL into gate-level netlists  
3. **Physical Design** – Floorplanning, placement, routing, and timing closure  
4. **Tapeout Prep** – Preparing GDSII for fabrication

## 📅 Weekly Progress Tracker

| Week | Focus Area | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Week 0 | Environment setup & tool installation | ✅ Completed |
| Week 1 | RTL coding & verification | In Progress |
| Week 2 | Logic synthesis & timing analysis | Pending |
| Week 3+ | Physical design & tapeout prep | Upcoming |

> Progress will be updated here every week as I advance through the SoC design flow.
